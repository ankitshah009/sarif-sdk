 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * - Replace `RULEID` with a valid value.
 *      It should be start with a prefix "SARIF", followed by 
 *      a 4 digit number which is the next sequential number available
 *      to use in ~\Sarif.Multitool\Rules\ directory.
 *      Example:
 *          SARIF1023
 *
 * - Replace `RULEFRIENDLYNAME` with a valid value.
 *      RULEFRIENDLYNAME should concisely define the purpose of this rule.
 *      Examples:
 *          UrisMustBeValid
 *          MessageShouldEndWithPeriod
 *
 * - Rename this file as <RULEID>.<RULEFRIENDLYNAME>.cs.
 * 
 * - Remove All INSTRUCTIONS after the changes have been made.

         * Error:
         *      In general, an `Error` should be reserved for rules which address

         *      SARIF1019.RuleIdMustBePresentAndConsistent
         *      Per spec, at least one of result.ruleId and result.rule.id must be present,

         *      
         * Warning:
         *      In general, a `Warning` is a good practice which should be followed, but it
